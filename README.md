## 🧠 Learning Note

I built **ConvoHub** not just as a project — but as a learning journey.
My approach has always been simple yet powerful:

> **Learn → Implement → Write.**

This cycle helped me understand complex frontend & backend systems deeply — from event-driven architecture to real-time data streaming.
